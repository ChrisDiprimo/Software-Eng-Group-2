Tortle.IO

The goal of this project is to create a simplistic, yet effective UI for the game
Tortle.io. The style of the UI is to be more lax as to fit the rather cozy and
laid back aesthetic. The project seeks to capitalize on the market of games
with a light hearted feeling, where danger surrounds them, yet they’re able
to confront it, with their little creature that they’ve been nurturing. That in
turn creates an enjoyable experience that the user will be gladly partaking in,
in their spare time.
